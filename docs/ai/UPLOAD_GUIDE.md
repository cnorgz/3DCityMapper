# Upload Guide

Bundle means single markdown bundle, not zip.

## What You Upload To SeniorDev (3 files)
1. `REFACTOR_LOG.md`
2. `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_MASTER.md`
3. One scope-specific bundle, usually:
   - `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE0-9.md`, or
   - `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE12.md`, or
   - `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE10-11.md`, or
   - `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE11-CODE.md`

## Optional Deep Evidence (1 file)
Include one deep-evidence markdown only when requested:
- `docs/ai/review_packet_phase12.md` for Phase 12 scope
- `docs/ai/review_packet_bundle_phase10-11_docs.md` for docs refresh scope
- `docs/ai/review_packet_bundle_phase11_code.md` for Phase 11 code scope

## Docs Layout Note
- Canonical documentation lives under `/docs`.
- Root-level similarly named files are stubs pointing to `/docs`.
- These duplicates are intentional for discoverability and backward links.

## Packaging Policy
Use markdown uploads. No zip is required for standard SeniorDev review.
