# Final Handoff Prompt (Refactor Track)

## Completion Snapshot
- Refactor execution through Phase 12 is complete.
- Phase 14 docs decisions resolved deferred scanner questions.
- Phase 15 provides merge/handoff readiness docs and final validation stamp.

## Explicitly Non-Blocking Next
- Scanner inference implementation (legend extraction/OCR/classification) remains future work.
- Current scanner pipeline remains placeholder + validated normalization path.

## Source Of Truth
