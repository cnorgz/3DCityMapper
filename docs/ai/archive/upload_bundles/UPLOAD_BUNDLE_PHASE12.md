# Upload Bundle — Phase 12 Wrap-up

## Purpose
Upload-ready summary for Phase 12 closure work focused on review simplification, docs/tooling audits, and final validation reporting.

## What Changed In Phase 12
- Added clear upload routing so review can proceed with 3 markdown files.
- Added/updated handoff documentation for SeniorDev reviewers.
- Added a markdown link-audit helper and committed audit output artifact.
- Performed final readiness-gated probe capture and logged parity outcome.

## Minimal Upload Set (SeniorDev)
Upload only:
1. `REFACTOR_LOG.md`
2. `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_MASTER.md`
3. `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE12.md`

## Optional Deep Evidence
If command-level evidence is requested, upload:
- `docs/ai/review_packet_phase12.md`

## Scope Notes
- This phase is docs/tooling-first and does not alter runtime architecture.
- Probe record is included only for final validation confidence.
