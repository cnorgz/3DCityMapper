# Upload Bundle — Phase 11 Code Work

## Purpose
Minimal upload facade for completed Phase 11 code-oriented refactor slices, so external review can be done with one summary markdown plus the log.

## Coverage
This bundle covers scanner/overlay code phases:
- Phase 11h, 11i, 11j
- Phase 11k, 11l
- Phase 11m, 11n, 11o

Notes:
- Phase 11p is a docs/index phase and is referenced as context only.
- Commit metadata and parity outcomes are sourced from `REFACTOR_LOG.md`.

## Minimal Upload Set
Upload only:
- `REFACTOR_LOG.md`
- `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE11-CODE.md`

## Optional Deep Evidence
If detailed per-phase evidence is requested, upload:
- `docs/ai/review_packet_bundle_phase11_code.md`

## Where To Find Probes
- Primary probe record: `REFACTOR_LOG.md` (Phase 11h..11o blocks)
- Per-phase command evidence: `docs/ai/review_packet_phase11h.md` through `docs/ai/review_packet_phase11o.md`

## Reviewer Guidance
- Parity gates remain tied to `sceneCounts`, `blueprintCounts`, and `overlayDrift` (`epsPx=0.05`).
- Hash variance is interpreted by v7 triage policy where applicable.
