# Upload Bundle — Phase 14 (Scanner Questions Decisions)

## Purpose
Upload-ready summary for Phase 14, which resolves deferred scanner questions at the documentation/spec layer.

## Scope
Phase 14 covers:
- `docs/SCANNER_DECISIONS.md` (new canonical decisions doc)
- Integration links in scanner/blueprint/coordinates docs
- Status and upload-routing doc updates
- Link-audit refresh artifact

## Minimal Upload Set (3 files)
1. `REFACTOR_LOG.md`
2. `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_MASTER.md`
3. `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE14.md`

## Optional Deep Evidence
- `docs/ai/review_packet_phase14.md`

## Notes
- This phase is docs/tooling-only and does not implement scanner inference runtime.
- Bundle format is markdown-only (no zip workflow).
