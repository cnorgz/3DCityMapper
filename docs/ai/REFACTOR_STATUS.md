# Refactor Status Snapshot

## Current Tip
- branch: refactor/phase13c-refactor-status-doc
- tip_commit: 910d753

## Completion Status (Phases 0–12)
- Phase 0: baseline parity anchor captured.
- Phases 1–4: early modular groundwork completed (see phase packets and log).
- Phases 5–9: renderer/editor/ui extraction series completed with parity-gated probes.
- Phases 10–11: docs closure + scanner placeholder scaffolding completed.
- Phase 12: post-plan wrap-up completed (upload simplification, docs/tooling audits, final validation probe).

Source of truth: `REFACTOR_LOG.md`.

## Deferred (Plan Section 10 — Scanner Questions)
From `REFACTOR_EXECUTION_PLAN_TIGHT_v7_rev4.md`, explicitly deferred:
1. Canonical legend colors/symbols per feature type.
2. OCR vs symbol markers for labels.
3. MVP scan scope (roads-only vs roads+water vs full zones/buildings).

## What To Upload For Review
Use the 3-file rule:
1. `REFACTOR_LOG.md`
2. `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_MASTER.md`
3. One scope-specific upload bundle (`docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE0-9.md`, `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE10-11.md`, `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE11-CODE.md`, or `docs/ai/UPLOAD_BUNDLE_PHASE12.md`).

Optional deep evidence: one matching `review_packet_*` bundle/doc when requested.
